It was pretty basic to be honest. i had to go into debt to pay for it. it was sold to me as an opportunity to join the tech industry. they had very glossy brochures of people working in rooms full of blonde wood and windows looking into big blue skies. obviously that is not the kind of work i now find myself in. there were heaps of old technologies in the class. everyone is just trying to find a job. the problem is, there are now thousands of us with this so call technical qualification. in thend it does not mean that much and does not pay very well.
